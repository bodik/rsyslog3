= rsyslog

Module provides way to develop and install rsyslog, and configures the instance
to server or client mode. By default clients forwards all messages to server,
server stores all logs on disk and forwards them to rediser (or other tcp line
oriented server) for further analysis. Classes supports autodiscovery of
components by avahi or statically by parameter.
